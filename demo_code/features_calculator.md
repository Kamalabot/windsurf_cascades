- Cosine (cos)
- Tangent (tan)
- Inverse sine (arcsin)
- Inverse cosine (arccos)
- Inverse tangent (arctan)
- Option to switch between degrees and radians
- Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh)

### Advanced Operations
- Square root (√)
- Power/Exponent (x²)
- Percentage calculations (%)
- Negative/Positive toggle (+/-)

### Geometric Calculator
- Area of a circle (A)
- Area of a rectangle (A)
- Area of a triangle (A)
- Perimeter of a circle (P)
- Perimeter of a rectangle (P)
- Perimeter of a triangle (P)
- Volume of a sphere (V)
- Volume of a cylinder (V)
- Volume of a cone (V)
- Volume of a cube (V) 

#### Geometric Calculator Features
- Each of the shape will have different UI rendered. 
- Also it will have unique test cases too.
