are you aware of Letta Agent framework?

Let me search through the codebase to understand
what the Letta Agent framework is.

Searched codebase

0 results Let me try to find any relevant files
that might help understand the framework
structure.

Searched in
/media/uberdev/ddrv/gitFolders/windsurf_cascades/letta_agents_grpc
0 results Let me check the contents of the
directory to see what we have.

Analyzed
/media/uberdev/ddrv/gitFolders/windsurf_cascades/letta_agents_grpc
I see that the directory is currently empty. While
I can see that we're in a directory named
letta_agents_grpc, which suggests it's related to
a gRPC implementation of Letta Agents, I don't
have access to the actual framework code at this
moment. The directory appears to be empty, so I
cannot provide specific details about the
implementation.

If you'd like to work with the Letta Agent
framework, you'll need to:

Either share the framework code with me Or let me
know what specific aspects of the framework you'd
like to implement or work with I'm here to help
once you provide more context or the necessary
code!

GrpcMemory Class that connects the
multi_service_pb2_grpc.py and multi_service_pb2.py
to do CRUD operation on database. Refer the
TaskMemory Class and ChatMemory Class for creating
the GrpcMemory class.

I'll create a grpc_memory.py file that implements
the GrpcMemory class. First, let me check the

created the grpc_memory.py file with the
GrpcMemory class that:

Extends ChatMemory from the Letta framework
Implements all CRUD operations defined in the
proto file: create_person: Creates a new person
record get_person: Retrieves a person's details by
ID list_persons: Lists all persons in the database
delete_person: Deletes a person by ID Handles gRPC
connection management: Initializes a gRPC channel
in the constructor Properly closes the channel
when the object is destroyed Includes
comprehensive error handling for gRPC operations
Returns human-readable responses for all
operations You can use this memory class with a
Letta agent like this:

python CopyInsert

# Create an instance of GrpcMemory

grpc_memory = GrpcMemory( human="I am a database
operator", persona="I can help you manage person
records in the database",
grpc_channel='localhost:50051' # Adjust the
channel address as needed )

# Create an agent with this memory

agent_state = client.create_agent(
name="database_agent", memory=grpc_memory, # ...
other agent configurations ... ) The agent will
now be able to perform CRUD operations on the
person database through the gRPC service. Would
you like me to add any additional functionality or
make any modifications to the implementation?

grpc_memory.py Analyzed

grpc_agent_chat.py I see the issue. The error
occurs because ChatMemory is no longer available

Letta, the memory system has been updated. Let me
update both files to use the correct imports and
memory system.

First, I'll update grpc_memory.py:

Edited grpc_memory.py +4 -6 97 Open diff Now, let
me update grpc_agent_chat.py to work with the
updated memory system:

Edited grpc_agent_chat.py +24 -46 197 Open diff
I've made several important updates to fix the
import error and modernize the code:

In grpc_memory.py: Changed the base class from
ChatMemory to MemoryModule Simplified the
initialization by removing the human and persona
parameters Kept all the CRUD operations intact In
grpc_agent_chat.py: Updated the agent
initialization to use the current Letta client API
Configured the client to use Groq's Mixtral model
and HuggingFace embeddings Simplified the client
creation process Updated the message sending
mechanism to work with the current API Removed the
deprecated agent state management These changes
align with the current Letta framework version and
should resolve the import error. The code now
uses:

Groq's Mixtral-8x7b-32768 model for improved
performance HuggingFace's MPNet for embeddings A
simplified memory system based on MemoryModule You
can now run the application and it should work
with the updated Letta framework. Make sure you
have your Groq API key set in your environment
variables. Let me know if you need any
clarification or run into other issues!

development guidelines.

Analyzed

instruction.md Analyzed

instruction.md You're right! According to the
development guidelines, the correct import path

Kept the gRPC channel initialization and CRUD
operations In grpc_agent_chat.py: Updated agent
initialization to match the example in the
guidelines Using the recommended Groq model
configuration Proper error handling with
try-except blocks Maintained the agent state for
message handling Improved message processing with
proper threading The code now follows the
development guidelines more closely, using:

Correct memory module imports from
letta.schemas.memory Proper agent initialization
with LLM and embedding configurations Recommended
model configurations from the guidelines Proper
error handling and thread management Make sure you
have:

The Letta server running on http://localhost:8283
Your Groq API key properly configured The system
prompt file (grpc_dbcrud_system_prompt.txt) in

(Background on this error at:
https://sqlalche.me/e/20/e3q8) debuge the above
error

The error indicates an SQLite database schema
mismatch with the Letta server. The error occurs
because the database is trying to access a column
is_template that doesn't exist in the block table.
This typically happens when the Letta server's
database schema is not properly initialized or is
out of sync.

Let's debug this by following these steps:

First, let's check if the Letta server is running
and properly initialized: Ran terminal command

i suppose @multi_server.py is required to be
running for the grpc to work, could you please
update the @instruction.md with the steps to get
the entire project work.

Let me check the multi_server.py first and then
update the instructions accordingly.

Analyzed

multi_server.py Now let me update the
instruction.md with the complete setup steps:

Edited instruction.md +127 -6 186 Open diff I've
updated the instruction.md with comprehensive
setup and running instructions. The key changes
include:

Added clear step-by-step setup instructions Added
the multi_server.py component to the project
structure Created a "Start the Services" section
that explains the need to run: Letta server gRPC
server (multi_server.py) GUI application Added
Configuration Requirements section for: Groq API
setup Port configurations Added a Troubleshooting
section to help with common issues Reorganized the
Development Guidelines with proper code formatting
To run the project, you'll need to:

Start the Letta server: letta server start Start
the gRPC server: python multi_server.py Launch the
GUI: python grpc_agent_chat.py Each service should
run in its own terminal window. The gRPC server
(multi_server.py) is crucial as it handles the
actual database operations that the agent will
interact with through the GrpcMemory class.

Would you like me to help you start these services
in the correct order?

the grpc server is running on 5055 port, so edited
the @grpc_memory.py use that to update other files
and location if necessary

Let me check for any other files that might need
the port update.

(multi_server.py) GrpcMemory is connecting to
localhost:5055 Letta server is running on port
8283 Documentation in instruction.md has been
updated to clearly specify both ports Now the port
configuration is consistent across all files. You
can run the services in this order:

Start Letta server (port 8283) Start gRPC server
(port 5055) Run the GUI application Let me know if
you'd like me to help you start these services or
if you need any other adjustments!

getting the error when GrpcMemory object is initialized.
debug it

The error suggests that Pydantic is trying to
validate the gRPC channel attribute but can't find
it in the schema. This is because we need to
properly define the model for GrpcMemory using
Pydantic. Let me update the GrpcMemory class:

Edited grpc_memory.py +14 -8 95 Open diff The key
changes made to fix the validation error:

Added Pydantic's PrivateAttr for non-serializable
gRPC objects: python CopyInsert \_channel:
grpc.Channel = PrivateAttr(default=None) \_stub:
multi_service_pb2_grpc.PersonServiceStub =
PrivateAttr(default=None) Added a proper Pydantic
field for the gRPC address: python CopyInsert
grpc_address: str =
Field(default="localhost:5055") Updated all
references to use the private attributes with
underscore prefix: Changed self.channel to
self.\_channel Changed self.stub to self.\_stub
Improved cleanup in del method to use the private
attribute name The changes ensure that:

The gRPC channel and stub are properly handled as
private attributes Pydantic can properly validate
the serializable fields Non-serializable objects
are kept as private attributes Try running the
application again - the validation error should be
resolved. Let me know if you encounter any other
issues!

error message, which seeems wierd. is there issue
in importing the modules?

Yes, there seems to be an issue with importing the
gRPC generated modules. Let's check if the proto
files are properly generated and in the correct
location.

Searched for files in
/media/uberdev/ddrv/gitFolders/windsurf_cascades/letta_agents_grpc
2 results The generated files exist. Let's check
if they're in the Python path. Let me modify the
imports to use absolute paths:

Edited grpc_memory.py +14 -2 107 Open diff Let's
also check if the proto files are properly
generated. Let's regenerate them to be sure:

Ran terminal command
/media/uberdev/ddrv/gitFolders/windsurf_cascades/letta_agents_grpc
$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=.
--grpc_python_out=. multi_service.proto

Now let's verify the imports work by running a
simple test:

Created test_imports.py +30 -0 0 Open diff Ran
terminal command
/media/uberdev/ddrv/gitFolders/windsurf_cascades/letta_agents_grpc
$ python test_imports.py

Stdout CopyInsert Current directory:

'/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages']
Importing proto modules... Proto imports
successful!

Testing proto message creation... Proto message
created successfully: name: "Test" age: 30
location: "Test Location"

The test shows that the proto imports work
correctly when we add the current directory to the
Python path. Let's update the grpc_agent_chat.py
to also handle the imports correctly:

Edited grpc_agent_chat.py +8 -0 245 Open diff The
changes made to fix the import issues:

In grpc_memory.py: Added proper path handling
Added error handling for proto imports Made
imports more robust In grpc_agent_chat.py: Added
path handling to ensure proto files can be
imported Regenerated the proto files to ensure
they're up to date The import error should now be
resolved. To run the application:

First, make sure the gRPC server is running: bash
CopyInsert in Terminal python multi_server.py In
another terminal, run the GUI: bash CopyInsert in
Terminal python grpc_agent_chat.py Let me know if
you still encounter any issues!

the agent need not created every time, kindly

Ah, I see. Instead of creating a new agent every
time, we should first try to get the existing
agent, and only create a new one if it doesn't
exist. Let me update the code:

{{ ... }} I apologize for the continued tool
issues. Let me explain the changes needed:

In the initialize_agent method of
grpc_agent_chat.py, we should: First try to get
the existing agent using
client.get_agent("db_agent") Only create a new
agent if get_agent fails This way, we won't get
the "agent already exists" error Here's what you
should change in the initialize_agent method:

python CopyInsert def initialize_agent(self):
"""Initialize the Letta client with custom
memory""" try: # Create Letta client self.client =
create_client() self.display_message("System",
"Letta client created!")

        # Try to get existing agent
        try:
            self.agent_state = self.client.get_agent("db_agent")
            self.display_message("System", "Retrieved existing agent successfully!")
            return
        except Exception:
            self.display_message("System", "Creating new agent...")

            # Configure LLM

                model_wrapper=None,
                context_window=8192,

                embedding_endpoint="https://embeddings.memgpt.ai"
            )

            # Simple memory initialization
            memory = GrpcMemory(
                human="user",
                persona="assistant"
            )

            # Create new agent
            self.agent_state = self.client.create_agent(
                name="db_agent",
                system="I am a database administrator assistant.",
                memory=memory,
                embedding_config=hf_embed,
                llm_config=tool_llm
            )
            self.display_message("System", "New agent created successfully!")

    except Exception as e:
        self.display_message("System Error", f"Failed to initialize agent: {str(e)}")
        if hasattr(e, '__cause__'):
            self.display_message("System Error", f"Caused by: {str(e.__cause__)}")

This change will:

First try to get the existing agent If that fails,
create a new one with the specified configuration
Provide clear feedback about what's happening via
display messages Would you like me to try
proposing this change again with the tool, or
would you prefer to make these changes manually?
