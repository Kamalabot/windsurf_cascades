# PLC Development Workflow and Toolchain on Linux

## Overview
The PLC development workflow involves several stages, from design to deployment, utilizing various tools and techniques to ensure efficient programming and operation of PLC systems. This document outlines the typical workflow and the toolchain used in Linux environments.

## PLC Development Workflow

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Define the project requirements, including the specifications for the PLC application.
   - Identify the hardware and software requirements.

2. **System Design**
   - Create system architecture diagrams to outline the PLC system's components.
   - Develop flowcharts or state diagrams to visualize the control logic.

3. **Programming**
   - Write PLC programs using a suitable programming language (e.g., Ladder Logic, Structured Text).
   - Utilize Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) or text editors for coding.

4. **Simulation and Testing**
   - Simulate the PLC program to test its functionality without deploying it on actual hardware.
   - Use simulation tools to validate the logic and ensure it meets the requirements.

5. **Deployment**
   - Transfer the PLC program to the PLC hardware.
   - Configure the PLC settings and connect it to the necessary I/O devices.

6. **Monitoring and Debugging**
   - Monitor the PLC operation in real-time to ensure it performs as expected.
   - Use debugging tools to troubleshoot and resolve any issues.

7. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed documentation of the PLC program, including comments in the code and external documentation.
   - Maintain records of changes and updates to the PLC program.

8. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - Regularly update the PLC program as needed based on changes in requirements or system upgrades.
   - Conduct periodic maintenance checks to ensure the PLC system operates reliably.

## Toolchain for PLC Development on Linux

### 1. **Programming Languages**
   - **Ladder Logic**: A graphical programming language commonly used for PLC programming. Ladder logic is based on the concept of using ladder diagrams to represent the control logic. It is easier to learn and understand compared to other programming languages due to its visual nature.
   - **Structured Text**: A high-level programming language for PLCs. Structured Text (ST) is an IEC 61131-3 programming language that is used to create PLC programs. It is a more advanced language compared to Ladder Logic and is usually used for more complex applications. Structured Text is similar to other high-level programming languages, such as C, and shares many of their features.

   Example of a Structured Text program:
   

### 2. **Development Environments**
   - **OpenPLC**: An open-source PLC development environment that supports various programming languages. It allows users to create, simulate, and deploy PLC programs on both real and virtual PLC devices. OpenPLC also provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and debugging PLC programs.
   - How to Install OpenPLC on Linux:
   > sudo apt-get install openplc

   - **Codesys**: A widely used PLC programming software that provides a comprehensive development environment.

   To install OpenPLC on Linux:
   > sudo apt-get install openplc

   To install Codesys on Linux:
   > sudo apt-get install codesys

### 3. **Simulation Tools**
   - **PLC Simulator**: Software that allows for the simulation of PLC programs to test logic before deployment.
   - **GRAFCET**: A graphical tool for modeling and simulating control processes.

   To install PLC Simulator on Linux:
   > sudo apt-get install plc-simulator

   To install GRAFCET on Linux:
   > sudo apt-get install grafcet

### 4. **Version Control Systems**
   - **Git**: A version control system to manage changes to the PLC code and collaborate with team members.

### 5. **Monitoring and Debugging Tools**
   - **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer to monitor communication between PLCs and other devices.
   - **PLC Debugging Tools**: Tools integrated within the development environment for real-time debugging.

### 6. **Documentation Tools**
   - **Markdown Editors**: Tools like Typora or Visual Studio Code for creating documentation in markdown format.
   - **Doxygen**: A documentation generator for C/C++ projects that can also be adapted for PLC code documentation.

### 7. **Deployment Tools**
   - **SSH/SCP**: Secure methods for transferring files to PLC hardware over the network.
   - **Web-based Interfaces**: Many modern PLCs provide web interfaces for configuration and deployment.

## Conclusion
The PLC development workflow on Linux involves a systematic approach to designing, programming, and deploying PLC applications. By utilizing the appropriate toolchain, developers can enhance productivity and ensure the reliability of PLC systems.
